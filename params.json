{"name":"Foulplay","tagline":"A Playstation Network app for Windows Phone 8","body":"### Sony neglected to make an official PSN application for Windows Phone. This app attempts to fill the void.\r\nCurrently, FoulPlay can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Manage Friends List (Add and remove friends, send and cancel friend requests)\r\n* View and compare trophy lists\r\n* Send and receive messages\r\n* View your and other users recent activity feeds.\r\n\r\n### Why Bother?\r\nI have two big reasons for wanting to create this app. First, Sony’s official PSN companion app for iOS and Android is a bit terrible. It uses a hybrid HTML5/Native interface. When the user interacts with their PS4, using the second screen or remote functions, it’s using a native interface built into the application. For everything else, it uses a basic HTML page, and a ton of JQuery calls. I’m sure they have valid reasons for this approach, but this app suffers from all the same web/fake native app tropes. \r\n\r\n* It’s too slow, especially if you have lots of data that you need to scroll through. \r\n* It does not conform to UI styles set by the platforms.\r\n* It does not conform to UI gestures set by the platforms. \r\n\r\nThis is especially true of the iOS app, where the back gesture between views is ignored. This is totally logical, since it’s not native, but it tries to look native and breaks the flow of the app.\r\n\r\nI hate fake native applications. I wanted to build a true native app as a proof of concept of how it could be done. Based on what I have so far, it sure is faster to say the least.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there is no official Windows Phone PSN app. Of course, considering they only bothered with Web apps on the other platforms, it makes total sense why they would not attempt anything here. But still, Windows Phone users got shafted again. There are some basic trophy applications made by other developers on the store, but most of them from what I can tell don’t actually work. They use an older, SOAP based API, which has been documented. I wanted those who are sticking with this platform, despite how other companies are treating it, to have something better. Or, at the very least, useable.\r\n\r\nIt’s basically the Windows Phone developers mantra; “Oh, it’s not coming out… Fuck it, I’ll just build it!”. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
